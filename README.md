### Sangly
CS 320 Final Project

We started our project by conducting a series of brainstorming sessions, during which we collaborated with AI to generate a multitude of innovative ideas. 
After careful consideration, we ultimately decided to focus on developing a smart desk that could detect motion sickness. Our personal experiences of commuting 
to MIT for class prompted us to make this decision, as we understood the challenges of finding a stable surface to work on and accessing a reliable internet 
connection.

To transform our desk into a smart and tangible interface, we integrated the necessary sensors and electronics. We developed various prototypes based on feedback 
from our classmates and professor, and eventually settled on a backpack design that included a desktop. This was the most efficient and portable solution since all 
students carry a bag or backpack to hold their belongings, eliminating the need for an additional item.
