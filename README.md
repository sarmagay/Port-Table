### Sangly
CS 320 Final Project

We started our project by conducting a series of brainstorming sessions, during which we collaborated with AI to generate a multitude of innovative ideas. 
After careful consideration, we ultimately decided to focus on developing a smart desk that could detect motion sickness. Our personal experiences of commuting 
to MIT for class prompted us to make this decision, as we understood the challenges of finding a stable surface to work on and accessing a reliable internet 
connection.

To transform our desk into a smart and tangible interface, we integrated the necessary sensors and electronics. We developed various prototypes based on feedback 
from our classmates and professor, and eventually settled on a backpack design that included a desktop. This was the most efficient and portable solution since all 
students carry a bag or backpack to hold their belongings, eliminating the need for an additional item.

The Getting_BPM_to_Monitor(2).ino code combines the heart sensor, led lighting, and fan activation code.
The BluefruitConfig.h, packetParser.cpp, and controller.ino files contain the code for the Flora Bluefruit circuit, connecting our phones to the device via bluetooth.
